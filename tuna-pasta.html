                So today we're going to make a quick and easy tuna pasta
                Drain the tuna and start boiling water, once it starts boiling add salt and a portion of the pasta of your choice.
                For best results let it cook for 6-7 minutes. ( (Al dente ;) )
                Once ready add tomate sauce and the tuna into a bowl and mix.

                Once cooked it should look like this.
