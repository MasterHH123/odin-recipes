                So today we're going to make a quick and easy tuna pasta
                Drain the tuna and start boiling water, once it starts boiling add salt and a portion of the pasta of your choice.
                For best results let it cook for 6-7 minutes. ( (Al dente ;) )
                Once ready add tomate sauce and the tuna into a bowl and mix.

                Maybe we should add another recipe but I don't know I'm kinda tired but fuck it.
                So we're going to make steak. Simply buy your choice of meat on a medium hot pan and season the meat with salt, pepper and a little bit of rosemmary and garlic.
                Let it cook on each side for 3 minutes and let it rest for 5 minutes afterwards.
                You can finally get your and <strong>enjoy your meat</strong>
