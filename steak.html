                    Maybe we should add another recipe but I don't know I'm kinda tired but fuck it.
                    So we're going to make a steak. Simply buy your choice of meat and put it on a medium hot pan and season the meat with salt, pepper and a little bit of rosemary and garlic.
                    Let it cook on each side for 3 minutes and let it rest for 5 minutes afterwards.
                    You can finally<strong> enjoy your meat</strong>
